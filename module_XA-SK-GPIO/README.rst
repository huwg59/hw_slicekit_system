The GPIO sliceCARD provides a collection of features to sliceKIT including 
LEDs, buttons and A/D inputs. Combined with xSOFTip it allows simple input/output 
functions to be evaluated easily, and provides I/O expansion to connect your 
sliceKIT to other systems. The quick start guide will help you get up and 
running with sliceKIT in seconds.

Features
--------

   * 4 LEDs
   * 2 buttons
   * One RS232 parallel cable with DB9 connector(cable not included)
   * 4 channel A/D via I2C interface
   * Thermistor input via A/D

Standalone demo
---------------
The standalone demo for this sliceCARD allows you to use xSOFTip to flash LEDs, 
read the ADC via I2C and output to the console via JTAG.
