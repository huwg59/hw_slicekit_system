sliceCARD overview
===================

Pack contents
-------------

   * One XA-SK-GPIO sliceCARD

GPIO access features
--------------------

   * A variety of xCORE ports of 1-bit, 4-bit and 8-bit type are exposed for access via 0.1" headers.
   * Access to 4 LEDs via a 4-bit port
   * Two push buttons are connected via a 4-bit port 
   * A small prototyping area is provided

RS232 UART
----------

   * A pair of 1-bit ports (one each for RX and TX) are used with an RS232 transceiver and DB9 connector to provide a standard UART terminal running up to 115.2 KBaud which can be connected to any PC COM port or Serial-to-USB adapter. 

4 Channel ADC With external temperature sensor
----------------------------------------------

   * An ADC with a standard 2-wire interface is provided, with an external linearized thermistor connected to the first ADC channel. The remaining 3 ADC channels are exposed on testpoints.
