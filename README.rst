XMOS sliceKIT
=============

Evaluating and developing with xCORE multicore microcontrollers is easy thanks to our flexible design kit, sliceKIT. 
sliceKIT comprises of a core board powered by a sixteen core xCORE flexible multicore microcontroller. It supports 
up to four I/O sliceCARDs.
 
The sliceKIT core board features our 16 core XS1-L16 device to deliver the deterministic, responsive processing 
required to handle a variety of peripheral interfaces, data processing and control tasks.
