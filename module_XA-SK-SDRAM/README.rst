The SDRAM sliceCARD provides a large external random access memory to sliceKIT, perfect for any 
application where a large external data buffer is required: image buffering for a display controller, 
audio buffering for effects processing, or perhaps data capture, processing and logging.


Features
--------

   * 8 MByte SDRAM
   * Clock speed up to 50 MHz
   * Data rate up to 80MBytes/second

Standalone demo
---------------
The standalone demo for this sliceCARD provides a simple example of reading and writing memory using the 
SDRAM xSOFTip.
