The LCD Display sliceCARD brings a 480 x 272 RGB display to sliceKIT. 
The xCORE multicore microcontroller drives the display directly without 
the use of an external LCD controller, via a parallel RGB interface.  
Using the xSOFTip LCD controller you can add a display to any system.  
The SDRAM slice could also be a useful addition to your system, providing 
additional data memory for frame buffering.

Want to drive a different display? - no problem, the LCD xSOFTip can 
easily be modified to support other display configurations, up to 800x600. 


Features
--------

   * 480 x 272 full color display 
   * 40-pin ZIF connector with ribbon cable to the display
   * Resistive touch screen with 2 wire interface to xCORE

Standalone Demo
---------------
The standalone demo for this sliceCARD drives the display with a refresh 
rate of 66Hz. A dual line buffer implementation uses the internal xCORE 
memory to display a bouncing 'X' on the screen.
