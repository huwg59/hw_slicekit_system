The Ethernet sliceCARD provides 100Mbps Ethernet connectivity to sliceKIT.
Combined with Ethernet xSOFTip, it allows XCORE multicore microcontrollers 
to be used in any embedded Ethernet system. You might want a TCP stack and 
webserver in your system, or maybe you need to provide highly responsive, 
low latency command and control over UDP, or even you own custom protocol.  
You might even want two Ethernet ports - xCORE gives you the flexibility to do it.

Features
--------

   * 10/100Mb Ethernet PHY 
   * RJ45 connector (cable not included)
   * MII interface to xCORE

Standalone demo
---------------
The standalone demo for this sliceCARD allows you to use xSOFTip to run a 
webserver on your xCORE multicore microcontroller. Using the TCP/IP and 
Webserver xSOFTip you can quickly extend this to provide Ethernet connectivity 
for any application.
